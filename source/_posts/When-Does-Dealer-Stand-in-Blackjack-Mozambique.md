#  When Does Dealer Stand in Blackjack Mozambique?

If you're playing blackjack at a casino in Mozambique, and you're not sure when to stand, here's a guide to help you make the best decision for your hand.

The basic rule of thumb is to stand when your cards add up to 17 or more points. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and it's important to be aware of them when playing blackjack in Mozambique. For example:

- If the dealer is showing an Ace, you should always stand if you have a total of 11 or higher. This is because the dealer could have a hot card (a 10) and go bust, which would give you a winning hand.

- If the dealer is showing a 2 through 6, you should always stand if you have a total of 12 or higher. This is because the dealer is likely to go bust if they have to hit on those low cards.

- If you have an Ace and a King (or any other face card), you can choose to either stand or hit depending on what the dealer's card is. For example, if the dealer is showing a 5, standing with an Ace and King would give you a total of 20 - which is likely to beat the dealer's hand.

#  Casino Dealers in Mozambique Standing When to Take Action

 Casino dealers in Mozambique may soon be standing at their tables rather than sitting, in an attempt to speed up the game and keep players interested.

The plan is to have the dealers standing for the entire game, rather than only during certain rounds, as is currently done in some casinos. This will require new training for the dealers, who will need to be able to keep track of the action while also dealing cards and chips.

Some people are already criticizing the plan, saying that it will make it more difficult for the dealers to see what's going on at the table. Others argue that it's simply a matter of getting used to and that players will appreciate the faster pace of the game.

No final decision has been made yet, but casino executives are said to be seriously considering the change.
