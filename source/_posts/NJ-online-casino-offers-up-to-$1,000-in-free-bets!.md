#  NJ online casino offers chance to win trip to Las Vegas

The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement recently announced that Resorts Casino Hotel would offer a trip to Las Vegas to one lucky player. The promotion is part of Resorts’ effort to promote its online casino site, which launched in November.

The trip includes airfare for two, three nights at the Wynn Las Vegas, and $1,000 in spending money. To be eligible for the drawing, players must have made a deposit and wagered at least $50 on the site.

Resorts Casino Hotel is one of four Atlantic City casinos that offers online gambling. The other three are Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Golden Nugget Atlantic City, and TropicanaCasino.com.

New Jersey became the third state in the US to legalize online gambling when Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law in February 2013. At first, only residents of New Jersey were allowed to gamble online, but the law was later amended to allow out-of-state players as well.

Online gambling has been growing in popularity since it first became legal in New Jersey. In May 2014, New Jersey’s online casinos generated $20 million in revenue, up from $11 million in April. Atlantic City’s brick-and-mortar casinos have been struggling in recent years, but online gambling has been helping to offset those losses.
