#  Dodgers Have Best Odds to Win 2017 World Series

A little over a week ago, Sports Illustrated released their annual MLB Preview issue. In it, they have odds for each team to win the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers have the best odds of any team in baseball at 9-1.

The Dodgers are coming off a season where they won 91 games and advanced to the National League Championship Series. They return nearly all of their key players from last year, including NL Rookie of the Year Corey Seager.

Their biggest offseason acquisition was second baseman Logan Forsythe from the Tampa Bay Rays. Forsythe is coming off a career-year in which he hit .264 with 20 home runs and 52 RBIs. He gives the Dodgers another middle-of-the-order threat to go along with Seager, Adrian Gonzalez, Justin Turner and Yasiel Puig.

The Dodgers also made a few smaller moves, signing relievers Tony Watson and Hector Rondon, as well as outfielder Franklin Gutierrez.

Bottom line: The Dodgers are loaded and have the best odds to win the World Series in 2017.

#  Dodgers Favored in Sports Betting for NL Pennant

The Dodgers have been listed as the favorites in the sports betting odds to win the National League pennant. Los Angeles is currently co-leader in the NL West with the Colorado Rockies, and they are listed as -150 favorites to win their division.

In the National League playoffs, the Dodgers are favored to reach the World Series. They are listed at +220 to win the pennant, while the Chicago Cubs are second favorites at +275. The Washington Nationals are next at +450, followed by the Milwaukee Brewers at +650.

The Dodgers have been one of the best teams in baseball this season, thanks to their strong offense and bullpen. Los Angeles is averaging 5.3 runs per game this year, which ranks third in MLB. The bullpen has also been excellent, with a 3.39 ERA that ranks fourth in the league.

The Cubs appear to be the biggest threat to the Dodgers in the playoffs. Chicago has a similar record and is also led by a strong offense. The Cubs have averaged 5.2 runs per game this year, ranking fourth in MLB. However, their bullpen has struggled with a 4.57 ERA that ranks 22nd in MLB.

The Nationals will also be a tough opponent for the Dodgers. Washington has a great pitching staff, led by Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg. The Nationals have a 3.43 ERA as a team, which ranks second in MLB. However, their offense has lagged behind this season, averaging only 4.2 runs per game (15th in MLB).

The Brewers could be another potential matchup for the Dodgers in the playoffs. Milwaukee has an excellent bullpen, thanks to Josh Hader and Jeremy Jeffress. The Brewers have a 3.49 bullpen ERA, which ranks fifth in MLB. However, their rotation is questionable beyond Chase Anderson and Zach Davies.

#  Los Angeles Dodgers Have 5/1 Chance to Win the World Series

The Dodgers were one game away from making it to the World Series last year. This year, they are considered one of the favorites to win it all. Their odds are at 5/1, according to Sports Odds.

The team has made a few changes since last season. They let Clayton Kershaw and Justin Turner go, and acquired Mookie Betts and David Price. Kershaw has moved on to the Washington Nationals, while Turner is now with the Cincinnati Reds.

Betts is one of the best players in baseball. The 28-year-old was an All-Star each of the past four seasons and won a batting title in 2018. He hit .346 last year with 32 home runs and 80 RBIs.

Price is coming off a disappointing season with the Boston Red Sox. However, he has been much better in his career in the postseason. The 35-year-old lefty is 9-2 with a 2.60 ERA in 16 postseason starts.

The Dodgers also have Cody Bellinger, who is one of the best young players in baseball. The 24-year-old hit 47 home runs last year and had 110 RBIs. He also won the NL MVP award.

Other key players for Los Angeles include Max Muncy, Walker Buehler, Corey Seager, and Russell Martin. Muncy hit 35 home runs last year and had 92 RBIs. Buehler was 8-5 with a 3.26 ERA last season and is expected to be their top starter this year. Seager missed most of last season due to injury but is back now and should be a big contributor offensively and defensively. Martin will be their primary catcher this season after Yasmani Grandal signed with the Milwaukee Brewers as a free agent.

The Dodgers are loaded with talent and should be one of the teams to beat this season

#  Dodgers Among Strongest Favorites to Win the 2017 World Series

The Dodgers are among the strongest favorites to win the 2017 World Series, according to Las Vegas odds.

After a disappointing 2016 season, the Dodgers have reloaded their roster and are looking poised to make a run at the championship. Led by superstar Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers have one of the most talented teams in baseball.

In addition to Kershaw, the Dodgers also boast an impressive lineup that includes Corey Seager, Justin Turner, and Yasiel Puig. They will be tough to beat this season.

The competition in the National League is going to be tough this year, but the Dodgers appear to be up for the challenge. They should be one of the top contenders for the World Series title.

#  Dodgers Seen as a Good Bet to Win the 2017 Major League Baseball Championship

The Dodgers are coming into the 2017 season with a lot of steam. They were one of the best teams in baseball last year, and they seem poised to make a run at the World Series this year.

Thereâ€™s a lot to like about the Dodgers. Their lineup is stacked with talent, and they have one of the best pitchers in baseball, Clayton Kershaw, leading the way. They also have a deep bullpen, which is important in the playoffs.

The Dodgers will be facing some tough competition in the National League this year. The Nationals are always a threat, and the Cubs should be better this year after making some key offseason acquisitions. But the Dodgers have as good of a chance as anyone to win it all this year.
