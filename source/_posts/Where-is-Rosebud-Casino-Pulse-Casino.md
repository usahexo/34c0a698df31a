#  FBI raid Rosebud Casino, questions over 'missing' funds

FBI agents descended on the Rosebud Casino in South Dakota yesterday, as part of an ongoing investigation into the casino's finances. The FBI has refused to comment on the precise nature of the inquiry, but sources close to the investigation say that agents are looking into allegations that millions of dollars have gone missing from the casino's accounts.

The casino's management has denied any wrongdoing, and insists that the missing funds were simply mislaid or stolen by employees. However, some analysts are skeptical of this explanation, pointing out that the casino's accounting procedures have been repeatedly criticised by federal regulators.

The raid is a major embarrassment for Rosebud Casino, which has been one of the most successful casinos in South Dakota in recent years. If it is found that the casino has been misusing its funds, it could face serious criminal penalties.

#  $10M vanished from Rosebud casino in just six months

The Associated Press reported that the Rosebud casino in Sisseton, South Dakota, had $10 million vanish from its coffers between April and October of last year. The news outlet obtained records from the state Gaming Commission which showed that the tribe-owned casino was unable to account for the disappearance of the money.

This is not the first time that money has gone missing from the casino. In 2016, around $2 million went missing. The commission opened an investigation into that incident, but was unable to determine what had happened to the money.

It is unclear how the $10 million disappeared, or where it went. A spokesperson for the commission said that they were working with the tribal leadership to try and resolve the issue. An attorney for the Rosebud Sioux Tribe declined to comment on the matter.

This revelation is just one more example of how tribes across America are struggling with financial woes. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe has been hit especially hard, as it has lost millions of dollars in revenue due to a decline in gambling profits. This decline is largely due to competition from casinos in other states.

In addition to financial troubles, the tribe has also seen a rise in suicides and instances of child abuse. The chairman of the tribe, Rodney Bordeaux, has said that these issues are a result of the "collapse of our economy."

#  State looking into financial issues at Rosebud casino

The state of Minnesota is investigating the financial issues at the Rosebud casino. The casino has been having financial difficulties for a few years, and the state is trying to determine if any money was lost due to mismanagement.

The investigation is being headed up by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), and they are working with the state's Gaming Commission to try and get to the bottom of things. So far, there have been no arrests made, and it's not clear if any wrongdoing took place.

The Rosebud casino is located in Duluth, and it's one of the largest casinos in Minnesota. It's also one of the most troubled, as it has been losing money for several years. In fact, its losses totaled more than $10 million last year alone.

The casino blamed its financial troubles on increased competition from other casinos in the area, as well as a decline in tourism. But some people believe that the casino may have been mismanaged, and that's why it's in such a bad financial shape.

The BCA is currently investigating whether or not that's true, and they're hoping to get to the bottom of things soon. In the meantime, the Rosebud casino remains open for business, although it's unclear how long it will be able to stay afloat.

#  What happened to the money at Rosebud casino?

There are still many unanswered questions surrounding the sudden closure of Rosebud casino in March of 2018. The $5 million that was missing from the casinoâ€™s funds has yet to be accounted for, and no one seems to know where it went.

The shutdown of the casino came as a surprise to both employees and customers alike. Management announced the closure with little warning, leaving many people out of work and leaving customers without access to their deposits.

At first, it was believed that the missing money was a result of casino hacking or theft. However, an investigation by the police revealed that the money had simply disappeared. No evidence of criminal activity was found.

So where did the money go? This is still a mystery, and no one seems to have any answers. Some people have suggested that the money may have been stolen by casino management or employees, but there is no concrete evidence to support this theory.

The closure of Rosebud casino has had a devastating effect on the local community. Many people have lost their jobs, and customers have lost millions of dollars in deposits. The lack of information from management has only made things worse.

Hopefully, someone will come forward with information about what happened to the missing money. In the meantime, Rosebud casino remains closed and shrouded in mystery.
