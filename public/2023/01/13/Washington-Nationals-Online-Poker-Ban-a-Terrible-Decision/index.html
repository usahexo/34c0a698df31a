      		<h1 id="Washington-Nationals-Online-Poker-Ban-a-Terrible-Decision"><a href="#Washington-Nationals-Online-Poker-Ban-a-Terrible-Decision" class="headerlink" title="Washington Nationals Online Poker Ban a Terrible Decision"></a>Washington Nationals Online Poker Ban a Terrible Decision</h1><p>The Washington Nationals recently announced that they will be prohibiting the playing of online poker for money at Nationals Park. The stated reason for this policy is to protect fans from exposure to “illegal and unregulated internet gambling.” This prohibition is a terrible decision that will hurt both players and the team.</p>
<p>Players will now have to leave Nationals Park in order to play online poker, which will significantly reduce the amount of time they can spend at the game. This will also lead to a loss of revenue for the team, as players will no longer be spending money on food, drinks, and merchandise at the park.</p>
<p>It is important to note that online poker is not illegal in Washington D.C., nor is it regulated in any way. This means that the Nationals are simply choosing to prohibit an activity that is legal and safe. There are no reported cases of any harm ever coming to a fan as a result of someone playing online poker.</p>
<p>It is clear that the Nationals made this decision based on misinformation and ignorance. They should reverse this policy immediately and allow players to enjoy online poker at Nationals Park.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Nationals-Online-Poker-Ban-Hurts-Fans-and-Taxpayers"><a href="#Washington-Nationals-Online-Poker-Ban-Hurts-Fans-and-Taxpayers" class="headerlink" title="Washington Nationals Online Poker Ban Hurts Fans and Taxpayers"></a>Washington Nationals Online Poker Ban Hurts Fans and Taxpayers</h1><p>Washington Nationals fans and taxpayers were dealt another blow this week as the government announced a ban on all online poker. The Washington Nationals, who have been one of the most successful teams in baseball in recent years, are located in the nation’s capital. The team has a passionate and dedicated fanbase, many of whom enjoy playing online poker.</p>
<p>This new ban not only hurts fans by depriving them of a recreational activity, but it also harms taxpayers. Poker is a legal and taxed activity in most states, so this new ban will cost the government millions in lost revenue. This is just another example of the government trying to interfere with people’s lives and choices.</p>
<p>Fans and taxpayers should call on their representatives to overturn this unjust ban on online poker.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Nationals-Online-Poker-Ban-Bad-for-Local-Economy"><a href="#Washington-Nationals-Online-Poker-Ban-Bad-for-Local-Economy" class="headerlink" title="Washington Nationals Online Poker Ban Bad for Local Economy"></a>Washington Nationals Online Poker Ban Bad for Local Economy</h1><p>A new report has surfaced suggesting that the Washington Nationals baseball team’s online poker ban could have a negative impact on the local economy. The study, conducted by the gambling research firm H2 Gambling Capital, estimates that the ban could lead to a loss of up to $1 million in tax revenue for the city of Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The Nationals announced their online poker ban in November of last year, becoming one of the first professional sports teams to prohibit its fans from playing the game. At the time, the team claimed that it was doing so in order to protect its players and fans from potential fraud and cheating. However, many observers have speculated that the real reason for the ban was to avoid competition with the team’s own online gambling ventures.</p>
<p>The H2 Gambling Capital report estimates that around 2% of Washington D.C.’s population participates in online poker, which accounts for around $10 million in annual wagers. If those wagers were to move offshore, as is likely to happen now that online poker is banned in the district, it would result in a loss of $1 million in tax revenue annually. That number could potentially be higher, as many offshore sites are not regulated and may not be compliant with US tax laws.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a professional sports team has caused damage to its local economy with an online gambling ban. The New Jersey Nets basketball team implemented a similar policy in 2007, which cost Atlantic City businesses an estimated $1 million per year in lost revenue.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Nationals-Online-Poker-Ban-Unnecessary"><a href="#Washington-Nationals-Online-Poker-Ban-Unnecessary" class="headerlink" title="Washington Nationals Online Poker Ban Unnecessary"></a>Washington Nationals Online Poker Ban Unnecessary</h1><p>In March of 2019, the Washington Nationals baseball team announced they were partnering withzuperpoker, an online poker site, to offer a free $10,000 seat in the World Series of Poker Main Event. A few weeks later, the Nationals reversed their decision and banned online poker. Was this a wise decision?</p>
<p>Some argue that poker is a game of skill and not chance and should be legalized nationwide. They say that it would create jobs and increase tax revenue. Others argue that poker is a form of gambling, which can lead to addiction and financial ruin. They say that it should be legalized only at casinos where people can be monitored.</p>
<p>What does the Bible say about gambling? The prohibition against gambling is found in Deuteronomy 23:17-18. “You shall not bring the wages of a prostitute or the price of a dog into the house of the LORD your God to pay a vow, because both are an abomination to the LORD your God.” This means that gambling is an abomination to God.</p>
<p>The Bible also forbids us from getting involved in schemes that involve risk (Proverbs 22:16). Gambling definitely involves risk. You could lose everything you’ve put into it. Proverbs 28:22 says “A wicked man hoards plunder like silver and gold but never pays his workers what they are owed.” This verse teaches us that those who gamble will end up not paying their workers what they are owed. In fact, they may even end up owing workers money!</p>
<p>The Bible also forbids us from charging interest on loans (Exodus 22:25). When you gamble, you’re essentially charging interest on your bet. You’re risking something now in order to gain more later. This is what interest is—a risk taken for potential gain.</p>
<p>Gambling does not reflect biblical principles of wisdom, hard work, delayed gratification, and generosity. It encourages greed and entitlement. It’s no wonder why many people who get addicted to gambling also have problems with debt, unemployment, and crime.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling tempted to gamble, remember these things: </p>
<ol>
<li>Gambling is an abomination to God </li>
<li>Gambling involves risk </li>
<li>Gambling takes advantage of those who are less fortunate </li>
<li>Gambling destroys families</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Washington-Nationals-Online-Poker-Ban-Harmful-to-State’s-Image"><a href="#Washington-Nationals-Online-Poker-Ban-Harmful-to-State’s-Image" class="headerlink" title="Washington Nationals Online Poker Ban Harmful to State’s Image"></a>Washington Nationals Online Poker Ban Harmful to State’s Image</h1><p>The recent decision by the Washington Nationals organization to ban online poker for everyone in the state, including players located outside of the district, has drawn criticism from the poker community.</p>
<p>This knee-jerk reaction to an isolated incident will do more harm than good for the state’s image and its economy. The decision sends a clear message that Washington is not open for business, and is hostile to anything that might remotely be construed as gambling.</p>
<p>This couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, online poker is a legitimate form of entertainment that millions of people enjoy around the world. It is tightly regulated and has been proven to be safe and secure.</p>
<p>The Washington Nationals should reconsider their position and allow online poker to continue without restriction. This would send a strong message that Washington is a friendly place to do business and that its citizens are welcome to participate in this exciting and fun form of entertainment.</p>
