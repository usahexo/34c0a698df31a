#  Pulse Casino Announces New Ambassador Program

 ## What is Pulse Casino?

Pulse Casino is a new online casino that has recently announced their ambassador program. The ambassador program is designed to help promote the casino and reward players for their loyalty.

## The Ambassador Program

The ambassador program is open to all players who have made at least one deposit at Pulse Casino. There are three levels of the ambassador program – bronze, silver, and gold – and players can progress through the levels by earning points. Points are earned by playing games at Pulse Casino, and different games earn players different amounts of points.

Players who reach the bronze level will receive a £10 bonus, while those who reach the silver level will receive a £25 bonus. The gold level is the highest level in the ambassador program, and players who reach this level will receive a £50 bonus. In addition, players at the gold level will be entered into a draw to win a holiday worth £1,000.

To progress through the levels of the ambassador program, players need to earn at least 100 points. Points expire after 90 days, so players need to make sure they use them within this time frame.
