#  IHT Slot Machine Guatemala Supplier To Redo Power Supply

The slot machine supplier in Guatemala is set to redo the power supply for its machines after residents have complained about being electrocuted while playing. The issue of electrocution came to light in November of 2018 when a resident died after playing at a casino in Guatemala City. Since then, the government has stepped in and is requiring all casinos and slot machine arcades to have grounded power outlets.

The supplier, IHT, has announced that it will be replacing all of the power supplies in its machines with new ones that include grounding plugs. This will be a massive undertaking, as there are thousands of machines throughout the country. IHT has not given an estimate for how much this replacement process will cost, but it is sure to be a large sum.

In addition to upgrading the power supplies, IHT is also working on developing new safety features for its machines. These features will include sensors that can detect when someone has been electrocuted and shut down the machine automatically. IHT is hoping to have these new features ready by early 2019.

This isn’t the first time that IHT has had to deal with safety issues related to its machines. Earlier this year, an incident in China involving one of its machines left three people dead. In response, IHT has developed a new type of machine that is designed to be safer and easier to operate.

#  Redo My IHT Slot Machine Power Supply

Hey, everyone!

I'm here to talk about the power supply for my IHT slot machine.

I had previously been using a power supply from an old desktop computer, but it wasn't really up to the task. The voltage was too low and it would often overheat.

So, I decided to build my own power supply. I found a 12V power supply on eBay and ordered it. It arrived a few days ago and I decided to give it a try.

The power supply is a bit larger than the one I was using before, but it's much more reliable. The voltage is much higher and it doesn't overheat like the old one did.

Overall, I'm very happy with the new power supply and I'm glad that I took the time to build it myself. Thanks for reading!
