It’s been just over 100 days since Donald Trump was sworn in as President of the United States, and the gambling odds websites are already predicting that he will only serve one term. Political pundits and journalists are already speculating about who might run in the next election, and how the Democratic party might fare against Trump. Some experts are suggesting that the Democrats could make a strong comeback, while others believe that the Republicans will hold onto the White House.

Trump’s first few months in office have been marked by controversy and mixed results. He has managed to achieve some key victories, such as getting Neil Gorsuch appointed to the Supreme Court, but he has also faced major setbacks, such as his failure to repeal Obamacare. His approval ratings have also been steadily declining, and it now looks like he may not be able to win a second term.

The Democrats are licking their wounds after their disastrous defeat in 2016, but they may have a chance at winning back control of Congress in the next election. They’ve been doing better in recent polls, and they’ve even managed to win a few special elections. However, they still have a lot of work to do if they want to take down Trump in 2020.

The Republicans are also facing some challenges heading into the next election. The GOP is deeply divided between its establishment wing and its populist wing, and it’s not clear whether Trump will be able to bridge this divide. He has had some successes in his first few months in office, but there is still a lot of uncertainty about what will happen next.

Whoever ends up running for President in 2020 is going to face a tough battle against Donald Trump. The race is still wide open, but it looks like Trump’s chances of winning another term may not be very good

#  Fortune of the East Game Predicts a Shortened Presidency for Donald Trump

The latest Fortune of the East game, a traditional Chinese predictive method, has Donald Trump’s presidency ending in 2020. This would be two years shorter than his original four-year term. The game, which is played by flipping coins, also predicted that Hillary Clinton would have won the election if it wasn’t for Trump’s win.

The current president has had a tumultuous start to his presidency, with low approval ratings and several high-profile controversies. The game’s prediction of a shortened term could be a sign that things are going to get worse for Trump before they get better.

There is no doubt that Trump is a controversial figure, and it’s still unclear how his time in office will play out. However, with the game predicting an early end to his presidency, it seems that he may not have the chance to make his mark on history.

#  Donald Trump's Presidency Could End Sooner Than Expected, According to Gambling Odds

As President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office draw to a close, many are wondering what the future may hold for him. Political analysts are weighing in on the possibility of impeachment or resignation, but what do the odds say?

According to gambling website Paddy Power, there is a 10% chance that Trump will leave office before his first term is up. This number may be surprising to some, especially in light of the recent scandals involving Trump and his administration.

The biggest reason for the decrease in Trump's chances of making it through his first term is the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In light of the investigation into Russian interference in the US election, the odds that Trump will be impeached have increased from 5% to 8%.

There is also a growing likelihood that Trump could be indicted as a result of Mueller's probe. This would likely lead to his resignation or impeachment.

While these odds are by no means a certainty, they provide a snapshot into how many people believe that Trump's presidency could come to an end sooner than expected.

#  Gambling Odds Say Donald Trump Won't Last the Whole Term as President 

The Huffington Post recently released an article on the gambling odds for President Donald Trump. According to the article, gamblers are putting their money on Trump not lasting the whole term as president.

According to the article, bookies have Donald Trump at a 2/1 chance of not completing his first term as president. They also have him at a 3/1 chance of being impeached in his first term.

While many in the United States may be hoping that these gambling odds are true, they may not be eager to put their money where their mouth is. However, it will definitely be interesting to see what happens over the next four years with President Donald Trump in office.

#  Donald Trump's Presidency Could Be Over Soon, According to Gambling Odds

As President Donald Trump's approval ratings continue to tank, the likelihood of his impeachment or resignation increases.

The latest odds from UK-based gambling site Ladbrokes show a 66 percent chance that Trump will either be impeached or resign before the end of his first term. That's up from 60 percent just one week ago.

The chances that Trump will be impeached during his first term now stand at 2-1, while the odds of him resigning are 4-1.

Both impeachment and resignation would require action by Congress, which has thus far shown little inclination to remove Trump from office.

But with the president facing mounting legal troubles and an FBI investigation that is likely to widen, it's possible that Republicans in Congress could change their tune.

A recent poll found that just 39 percent of Republicans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, down from 84 percent just after he was sworn in.
