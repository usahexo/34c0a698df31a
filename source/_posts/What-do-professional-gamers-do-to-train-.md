#  What do professional gamers do to train? 

Most professional gamers take their training seriously and use various techniques to improve their skills. Some of the most common methods include practicing regularly, watching and analyzing their own and other players' gameplay footage, playing with different skill levels, and using gaming tools and aids. 

One of the best ways to improve your gameplay is to practice as often as possible. Most professional players will play for several hours every day in order to get better at the game. This may seem like a lot, but it's necessary in order to keep up with the competition. 

In addition to practicing, examining your own gameplay footage can also be helpful. By watching yourself play, you can see what mistakes you're making and where you need to improve. Watching other players' footage can also give you new ideas and strategies to try out. 

Playing against different skill levels is another great way to become a better player. If you only play against weaker opponents, you'll never learn how to beat tougher ones. By playing against players who are better than you, you'll be forced to adapt and learn new strategies. 

And finally, using gaming tools and aids can also help train your brain for gaming. There are many different tools available, such as those that help improve hand-eye coordination or focus. Using these tools can help make you a better player overall.

#  How do teams decide who will represent them in competitions? 

Most competitive teams have a set of guidelines they use to determine which players will represent them in competitions. 

One common approach is to use a selection tournament. In this format, every player in the team competes against each other in a series of matches. The winner of each match moves on to the next round while the loser is eliminated. This process continues until there is only one player left standing, and that player is then crowned the champion and becomes the team's representative in competitions. 

Another approach is to use rankings. In this system, the players are ranked according to their ability and the top players are chosen to represent the team. This approach is often used in sports such as tennis and golf where players compete against each other in tournaments to earn ranking points. The player with the most ranking points at the end of the season is typically chosen to represent the team in competitions. 

A third option is to use a vote. In this scenario, all of the players on the team vote on who they think should be the representative. This system can be used when there are a lot of good players on the team or when there is no clear-cut champion from the selection tournament. 

No matter which system is used, it's important that everyone on the team agrees with the decision so that there is no animosity among teammates.

#  How do sponsorships work in the esports industry? 

The esports industry is growing rapidly, and with that growth comes an increasing demand for sponsorships. Sponsors provide the financial backing necessary for teams and players to compete at the highest level, and in return they receive exposure to a large and engaged audience. But what exactly do sponsors get in return for their investment, and how does the process of securing a sponsorship work?

Sponsorships come in many different forms in esports. The most common type is a financial sponsorship, where a company provides money to a team or player in exchange for advertising and exposure. Other types of sponsorships include product sponsorships (where a company provides gaming gear or other products to teams) and event sponsorships (where a company pays to have its name attached to an esport event).

To secure a sponsorship, teams and players typically reach out to potential sponsors directly. They send proposals outlining what they can offer the sponsor in terms of exposure and advertising, as well as what the sponsor can expect in return. These proposals are then evaluated by the sponsor, who decides whether or not to pursue a sponsorship agreement.

Sponsorships are important for the continued growth of esports. Teams need financial backing to be able to compete at the highest level, and sponsors provide that support. In turn, sponsors receive exposure to a large and engaged audience, which can be beneficial for their business. As esports continues to grow, we can expect to see more and more companies getting involved in sponsoring teams and players.

#  Who determines the rules and format of each esport? 

The rules and format of various esports are determined by the game's developers and publishers. Blizzard, Riot Games, and Valve all have a great deal of control over their respective games and determine the ruleset, format, and even which teams can participate in tournaments. This has led to some rivalries between developers, as different games have different rule sets and formats.

For example, Blizzard has been known to strictly enforce its rules for its games, while Valve is more relaxed. This has led to some unhappiness among Valve's player base; for instance, there are many complaints about the way that Valve runs the Majors for its game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. In contrast, Blizzard's tournaments generally run very smoothly, with few complaints from players or spectators. 

Different developers also have different attitudes towards gambling. While Valve has allowed third-party sites to offer betting on its matches, Blizzard has expressly forbid any form of gambling on its games. This has caused some friction between Blizzard and the companies that offer betting on Overwatch matches; one site, CSGO Lounge, has filed a lawsuit against Blizzard alleging that the prohibition is anti-competitive.
