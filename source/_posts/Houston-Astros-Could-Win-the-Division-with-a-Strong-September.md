#  Houston Astros Could Win the Division with a Strong September

The Houston Astros are looking to win the division this year, and they could clinch it with a strong September. The Astros have been one of the best teams in baseball all season long, and they should be able to win the division with a few wins this month.

Houston has had an impressive season so far, thanks in part to their stellar offense. The Astros are currently averaging 5.4 runs per game, which is the third-highest mark in baseball. They have also been outstanding defensively, as they have the lowest fielding percentage in the majors.

Houston will need to continue playing well if they want to win the division. The Texas Rangers are currently just one game behind them in the standings, and they will be looking to overtake Houston in September.

The Rangers have been one of the biggest surprises in baseball this year. They were expected to compete for a playoff spot, but few people thought that they would be able to win the division. Texas has been led by their offense, as they are averaging 5.2 runs per game this season.

The Rangers have also been solid defensively, as they have the fifth-lowest fielding percentage in baseball. They will need to continue playing well if they want to catch up to Houston this month.

Houston and Texas are both very good teams, and it should be a close race for the division title down the stretch. However, the Astros should be able to prevail thanks to their strong offense and defense.

#  Seattle Mariners Poised to Overtake Astros with Late Season Push

The Seattle Mariners have been one of the most exciting teams to watch in baseball this season. With an influx of young talent, they have managed to stay in the playoff hunt until the last few weeks of the season. Now, with just a few games left to play, they appear poised to overtake the Houston Astros for first place in the American League West Division.

Led by outfielder Nelson Cruz and starting pitcher James Paxton, the Mariners have been playing some of their best baseball at the right time. In fact, they are on a six-game winning streak as of this writing. If they can continue to play well down the stretch, they should be able to secure a playoff berth for the first time since 2001.

For many years, the Astros were considered the team to beat in the AL West. However, with their recent struggles and the resurgence of the Mariners, that is no longer the case. In order to regain their throne as the top team in their division, Houston will need to play better in the final few games of the season. Otherwise, they could find themselves watching the playoffs from home instead of participating in them.

No matter what happens in these final few games, it has been a great year for Seattle fans. With so much young talent on display, there is plenty of reason to be optimistic about future seasons. And if they can manage to overtake Houston and win their first division title in 17 years, that would be an even sweeter victory indeed.

#  Oakland Athletics Looking to Climb in AL West Standings

The Oakland Athletics will enter the 2019 season with high expectations after coming close to a playoff berth last year. The team finished just two games back of the final Wild Card spot in the American League and will look to make a run at the postseason this season.

One big reason for the A's optimism is their lineup, which is headlined by 2017 MVP runner-up Khris Davis. Davis led the A's in home runs (48) and RBIs (123) last season and will be looking to build on that success in 2019. He will be joined in the lineup by fellow All-Stars Stephen Piscotty and Matt Chapman, as well as veterans Jed Lowrie and Josh Reddick.

Oakland's pitching staff is also packed with talent, led by ace Sean Manaea. The 26-year-old lefty posted a 13-9 record with a 3.82 ERA last season and should be even better in 2019. He will be joined by fellow starters Daniel Mengden, Frankie Montas, and Brett Anderson, as well as closer Blake Treinen, who led the AL with 38 saves last season.

All of that talent could lead to some big things for the Athletics this season. If they can stay healthy and gel as a team, they could very well end up in the postseason for the first time since 2014.

#  Los Angeles Angels on the Verge of Falling Out of Playoff Picture

The Los Angeles Angels have had a disappointing season so far. They are currently in fourth place in the AL West and six games out of first. Their offense has not been as good as they had hoped, and their pitching has not been consistent.

If the Angels want to make the playoffs, they will need to turn things around quickly. Luckily, they still have over two months left in the season, so there is time for them to make a comeback. However, they will need to start winning soon if they want to stay in contention.

The Angels' next few games are against the Baltimore Orioles and the Toronto Blue Jays. These teams are not as strong as the Angels, so this would be a perfect opportunity for them to start winning again.

If the Angels can't manage to turn things around soon, they may end up missing out on the playoffs altogether. This would be a huge disappointment for both the team and its fans.

#  Texas Rangers Eyeing Second Place in AL West

The Texas Rangers have been one of the most inconsistent teams in baseball this season. They currently sit in fourth place in the AL West, but they are only four games back of second place. The Rangers have some talented players on their roster, and they could make a run at the playoffs if they can get things turned around.

Texas has some talented young players who are starting to come into their own. Joey Gallo is one of the most impressive rookies in baseball. He has already hit 22 home runs this season, and he is just getting started. Nomar Mazara is another young player who is starting to make an impact. He has already hit 15 home runs this season, and he is proving that he can be a major contributor for the Rangers.

The Rangers bullpen has also been a strength this season. Sam Dyson has been one of the best closers in baseball, and he has been a big reason why the Rangers have been able to stay competitive. The rest of the bullpen has also been solid, and they should continue to be a strength for the team down the stretch.

If the Rangers can get things turned around, they have a chance to make a run at the playoffs. They have some talented players who are capable of making an impact, and they will be battle-tested after playing in one of the toughest divisions in baseball. The Rangers are definitely a team to watch over the next few weeks.
